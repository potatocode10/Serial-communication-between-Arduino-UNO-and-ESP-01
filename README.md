## ⚡ Requirements
1. **Hardware**:  
   - Arduino UNO board  
   - ESP-01 WiFi module  
   - Connecting cables and breadboard  
   - Button  
   - LED  

2. **Software**:  
   - Arduino IDE installed on your system. Download it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  

3. **ESP8266 Board Manager Library**:  
   If you do not see the ESP8266 library in the Arduino IDE, follow these steps:  
   - Go to **File > Preferences** in the Arduino IDE.  
   - In the field labeled **Additional Board Manager URLs**, enter the following URL:  
     ```
     https://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
     ```
   - Click **OK** and then go to **Tools > Board > Board Manager**.  
   - Search for "ESP8266" and install the package.

## 🔧 Communication Setup
You can establish communication between the Arduino UNO and ESP-01 in two ways:

1. **Using UART (Hardware Serial)**  
   - Connect the ESP-01 module using a **cross connection**:  
     - ESP-01 TX → Arduino UNO RX  
     - ESP-01 RX → Arduino UNO TX  
   - Ensure proper voltage levels (ESP-01 operates at 3.3V).  

2. **Using Digital Pins with a Library**  
   - Use a library like `SoftwareSerial` to configure communication via any digital pins.  
   - For example:  
     ```cpp
     SoftwareSerial mySerial(2, 3); // RX, TX
     ```  
   - Connect the ESP-01 module using a **cross connection**:  
     - ESP-01 TX → Arduino UNO Pin 2 (RX)  
     - ESP-01 RX → Arduino UNO Pin 3 (TX)
